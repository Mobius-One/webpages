    <h1>SRHelper is a click emulator for the game Stream Raiders.</h1>
    <h2>Download for Google Chrome at the extension store <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/srhelper/flgahoglenmjoegheodkhahipokcilal">here</a></h2>
    <label></label><br>
    <div class="container">
        To get started, load the game after installing the extension and click on the extension icon on the extensions
        tab. That will open the AutoRaiders popup screen.<br>The popup has several settings to tailor the gameplay to
        your
        needs. Some of them are mandatory such as which units are allowed to be placed.<br>
        Below is the explanation of all the extension settings and how they work:
    </div><br>
    <table border="1">
        <tr>
            <td>Switch idle captain: The extension works with both live and offline captains. It will always switch to a
                campaign captain</td>
            <td>Switch idle captain after 15 minutes, the idle states are: if a captain doesn't find a battle, doesn't
                start a battle or doesn't collect the reward.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Leave slot empty if there aren't any loyalty captains to switch</td>
            <td>After removing an idle captain, by default the extension will seek a captain with loyalty: diamond,
                gold, silver, then bronze. If it doesn't find any it will seek a favorited captain. If doesn't find any
                it will randomly select one, if this option is enabled it won't select a random captain if a loyalty/favorite
                captain isn't available.</td>
